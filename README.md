# chengine
Minimax chess engine

Plays chess using a minimax algorithm.

TODO:
- Add alpha-beta pruning
- Make GameState struct smaller, maybe collapse boolean variables into one variable
- Experiment with different ways of populating the GameState tree... find what works best
- Make the evaluation function more sophisticated!
- Make a branch of this repo which uses a Monte Carlo search tree instead and implement a neural network
- Make it so that king can't castle over checked squares! He has the potential to do that as of now
